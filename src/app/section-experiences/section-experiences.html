          <p>As a developer I work on few projects for customer from Switzerland that collect data from stock exchanges,
            store them in database and provide additional information for users to show, where they should or should not
            invest their money. Team consists of two developers from Slovakia and three developers in Switzerland. Main
            project that I am working on is web application, where people from economic department can manage their data
            (products / underlyings). Web user interface contains many forms, graphs to present data from database. In
            the past, this application was written in Java and main task was to re-implement it into NodeJS, nowadays
            all functionality is migrated and we develop new features. Few technologies that are used in projects are
            Java, Maven, NodeJS, BackboneJS, AngularJS, ActiveMQ, SQL Server, Solr and others.</p>
