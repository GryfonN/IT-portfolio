            I worked on few projects for customer from Switzerland that collect data from stock
            exchanges, store them in database and provide additional information for users to show, where they should
            or should not invest their money. Team has consisted of two developers from Slovakia and three developers
            in Switzerland. Web user interface contains many forms, graphs to present data from database. In the past,
            this application was written in Java and main task was to re-implement it on server-side into NodeJS and
            BackboneJS on client-side. .
