            As a developer I have worked on few projects for customer from Switzerland that collect data from stock
            exchanges,
            store them in database and provide additional information for users to show, where they should or should not
            invest their money. Team has consisted of two developers from Slovakia and three developers in Switzerland.
            Main project that I was working on was web application, where people from economic department can manage
            their data (products / underlyings). Web user interface contains many forms, graphs to present data from
            database. In the past, this application was written in Java and main task was to re-implement it on
            server-side into NodeJS and BackboneJS on client-side. Few technologies that are used in projects are Java,
            Maven, NodeJS, BackboneJS, AngularJS, Grunt, ActiveMQ, SQL Server, Solr and others.
